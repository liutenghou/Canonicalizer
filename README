This java program turns an equation into its canonical form.
For example:
x^2 + 3.5xy + y = y^2 - xy + y

Should be transformed into:
x^2 - y^2 + 4.5xy = 0

Files Included:
Canonicalize.java //main class
Term.java
MalformedInputException.java
InputTest.java //JUnit Tests
input.txt //input equations for testing

HOW TO RUN:
either press f for file, or i for interactive at initial prompt
if(f) type: input.txt (should be placed in the root directory)
if(i) enter equation and press enter
type control-c to exit

Implemented:
Two modes of operation: file and interactive. 
In interactive mode application prompts user to enter equation and displays result on enter.  
This is repeated until user presses Ctrl+C. 
In the file mode application processes a file specified as parameter 
and writes the output into separate file with â€œ.outâ€� extension. 
Input file contains lines with equations, each equation on separate line. 

Not Implemented:
 - Out of order variables. ie. xy = yx, the justification for not implementing this
 is the assumption that a variable may be multiple letters, for example "cat" and "bat" are different
 whole variables which share some letters, and may not be the variables c,a,t and b,a,t.
 If we assume that variables are single letter, then we could break down the variables
 into x^k or x forms in an array in Term.java, and iterate through them when matching.
 - larger than Double value coefficients
