This java program turns an equation into its canonical form.
For example:
x^2 + 3.5xy + y = y^2 - xy + y

Should be transformed into:
x^2 - y^2 + 4.5xy = 0

Files Included:
Canonicalize.java //main class
Term.java
MalformedInputException.java
InputTest.java //JUnit Tests
input.txt //input equations for testing

Implemented:
Two modes of operation: “file” and “interactive”. 
In interactive mode application prompts user to enter equation and displays result on enter.  
This is repeated until user presses Ctrl+C. 
In the file mode application processes a file specified as parameter 
and writes the output into separate file with “.out” extension. 
Input file contains lines with equations, each equation on separate line. 

Not Implemented:
 - Bracket handling
 - Out of order variables. ie. xy = yx
 - larger than Double value coefficients
